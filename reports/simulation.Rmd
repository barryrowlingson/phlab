# Simulating Data Sets

```{r start}
library(devtools)
load_all("../phlabr")
library(sf)
```

With a CSV file having three columns like:

```
Total,Year,Specimen date
3,2012,01/01/2012
5,2012,02/01/2012
```

Then fit a Poisson GLM to time:

```{r read}
m = fit_time_file(opts$c)
```

Read in the postcode database:

```{r pcs}
pc = st_read(opts$p,"postcodes")
```

Simulate the data:

```{r sim}
ss = sim_data(m, pc)
head(ss)
```

which produces an `sf` object with `Date`, `postcode`, and `geometry`
columns, being the point location of the postcode.
